# MIU Network Infrastructure Project 🌐

A full-scale enterprise network simulation built in Cisco Packet Tracer. Designed for Misr International University, this project demonstrates advanced networking concepts including VLSM, VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, OSPF, EIGRP, DHCP, NAT, and centralized services.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ VLSM subnetting with optimized IP allocation
- 🧩 VLAN creation and trunking across switches
- 🔁 Inter-VLAN routing via Layer 3 switches
- 📡 OSPFv2 and EIGRP routing with redistribution
- 🧭 Static and default routing for ISP integration
- 🧰 DHCP server configuration (Main & Branch)
- 🌐 NAT with PAT and static mappings
- 🕒 NTP and Syslog centralized management
- 📧 Email, DNS, and Web server setup

## 📁 Files

- `packet_tracer/MIU_Network.pkt`: Full simulation file
- `documentation/Network_Project_Documentation.docx`: Detailed design and addressing tables
- `configs/`: CLI configurations for key devices (optional)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- IPv4, VLANs, OSPF, EIGRP, NAT, DHCP
- Network services: DNS, Web, Email, NTP, Syslog

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open `MIU_Network.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Review documentation for IP addressing and VLAN setup.
3. Explore routing tables, NAT translations, and server configs.
